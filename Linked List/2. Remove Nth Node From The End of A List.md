## Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

#### Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

### Example 1:
```

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

### Solution
```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    
    ListNode start = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode slow = start, fast = start;
    slow.next = head;
    
    //Move fast in front so that the gap between slow and fast becomes n
    for(int i=1; i<=n+1; i++)   {
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    //Move fast to the end, maintaining the gap
    while(fast != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    //Skip the desired node
    slow.next = slow.next.next;
    return start.next;
}

```

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
